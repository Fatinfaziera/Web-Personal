		<h3><big>Experience</big></h3>

		<p> In November 2021, I got involved in the business. This is because, in the subject Fundenmental of Entrepreneurship (ENT300) there is an individual assignment that requires students to start own business my selling any of products. I have started my business on 22 Novemebr 2021 till 26 November 2021. I have been selling chips made from spring roll pastry consisting of various types of flavors. The brand of chips is N'Z Crunchies.</p>
                
                <br /><br />
                <p>I have taken a total of 13 jars (220 grams) and I have managed to sell all the jars of the chip in 5 days. This is my first time running my own business. At first I had difficulty promoting the product as I did not have any experience in selling. However, with the help of my lecturer and the support of family and friends, I have managed to perform this task within the before submission date. Honestly, doing business is not an easy thing because it requires knowledge and need to formulate a strategy to run a business. </p>
                
                <br /><br />
                <p>Modal that i need to spent to buy 10 jars of the chips is RM100 and I have managed to earn RM 146. However, for the net I only have RM 31 after deducting expenses for the packaging of the product. However, I am still satisfied with my sales results.</p>
                
                <br /> <br />
                <p>For me this was an experience I will never forget. The thing is I never thought of doing business as I have not much interest in business. Plus, while carrying out the assignment, I gained a lot of knowledge.</p>
