		<p> In 2013, I sat for Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) and I have managed to obtain 3A 1B 1C. Although I did not get a 5A, I was still satisfied with the results I got. When taking the UPSR results, I was accompanied by my parents. My parents are so proud of my exam results. With the results of the exam, my parents gave me a smartphone as a gift. That was one of the most memorable moments for me.</p>

		<br /><br/> 
		<p>Next, in 2016, I sat for the Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3 (PT3) exam and I managed to obtain a 4A. I was very thankful for the results that I got. I was placed in the account class During form 4. At first, I didnâ€™t much like entering the account class since I was not interested in the account subject. However, I kept trying and study hard to do my best.</p>

        <br /><br/> 
        <p>After that, in 2018, I sat for the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) examination. Before exam day, I felt a little stressed as I needed to get excellent results to enable me to place myself in university. In addition, my parents expectations are very high since I am the last child. However I am thankful to have parents, teachers and friends who gave me a lot of guidance and motivation. So with that, I managed to get 4A 3B 1C in the SPM examination.</p>

        <br /><br/>
        <p>After I obtained the results, I decided to apply to continue my studies at the diploma level at UiTM and I managed to place myself at UiTM Negeri Sembilan Branch, Rembau Campus for Dimploma in Information Management course. The reason I chose the information management course is because it does not have a computational subject and I want to venture into a new field.</p>
